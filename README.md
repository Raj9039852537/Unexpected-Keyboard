The main feature is easy typing of more characters by swiping the keys toward the corners.

Highlight of some of the features:

- Every character and special keys of a PC keyboard. This is perfect for using applications like Termux.

- This includes Tab, Esc, the arrows and function keys, but also Ctrl and Alt.

- Accented keys are accessible using dead keys. First activate the accent, then type the accented letter.

- Very light and fast. Use 500x times less space than Google's keyboard and 15x times less than the default keyboard. No ad, no tracking.

- Personalizable with many options, layouts and themes.

Like any other virtual keyboards, it must be enabled in the system settings. Open the System Settings and go to:
System > Languages & input > On-screen keyboard > Manage on-screen keyboards.
